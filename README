The point of this project is to get a high/low tide report emailed to me
on a daily basis. Because I intended this to be only a simple script to
handle a specific job, I did not plan it out as a project. Once it is
working for its original purpose, I'll start to rework the entire thing
properly. In the meantime, take it for what it's worth, and use it how
you'd like.
